## PTIT.EigenAI – Digital HandWriting for Online Learning 

This is a project by Team PTIT.EigenAI, led by Doan Viet Anh, who is responsible for all product coding tasks, team leardership, and task allocation. 

During the learning process, paper, boards, and pens are effective tools for expressing ideas and explaining concepts. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic, these tools became unsuitable for online learning and meetings. Computers, graphic tablets, or a mouse can serve as alternatives, but they present challenges in terms of cost and user experience (writing with a mouse is difficult, and tablets are expensive). Our solution is to use a smartphone camera to detect paper, extract and filter handwritten notes or drawings, stream them onto online educational platforms. This allows students to continue using paper and pen as they would in offline seasons. Additionally, we developed a web application to support group study and online meetings.
